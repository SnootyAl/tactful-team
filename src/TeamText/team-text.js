	C: {
		low: `scored on the lower end of conscientiousness – they may be more likely to be impulsive, 
        and less likely to plan things out, as they prefer working to their own schedule. 
        It might be worth checking in on them periodically to keep them on track.`,
		high: `scored on the higher end of conscientiousness – they may be best suited to planning 
        and setting goals for the project. Be careful with micromanaging, however – 
        not everyone is deliberate as you.`,
	},
	A: {
		low: `scored on the lower end of agreeableness – this means they may be more 
        stubborn than the rest of the team. When trying to find compromise, remember 
        to take it slow, think about their point of view, and try and avoid sayings 
        things such as “No, you’re wrong”.`,
		high: `scored on the higher end of agreeableness – they are most likely caring, 
        honest, and always ready to help out. If you’re struggling with a problem, no matter 
        the size, or trying to find a mediator in an internal conflict, they might be a great 
        person to ask for help.`,
	},
	N: {
		low: `scored on the lower end of neuroticism – this means they may be more optimistic, worry 
    less, and have an ability to keep calm in stressful situations. When deadlines are fast 
    approaching, or the team starts panicking, they may be the level-headed rock that keeps 
    you moving in the right direction.`,
		high: `scored on the higher end of neuroticism – this means they might get stressed easily 
    or feel vulnerable or insecure, and may blame themselves when things go wrong. It’s 
    important to keep encouraging them when times get tough, and help them make the best 
    of the situation.`,
	},
	O: {
		low: `scored on the lower end of openness – this may mean they avoid change and prefer to do 
        things in a familiar way. They may only consider concepts in straightforward ways, which is 
        sometimes the best approach.`,
		high: `scored on the higher end of openness – this means they may enjoy trying new things, 
        have a good imagination, and be more creative. When the project hits a roadblock, and the 
        team is looking for inspiration, they may have the creative spark to get you going again – 
        all you have to do is listen.`,
	},
	E: {
		low: `scored on the lower end of extraversion, meaning they may be more reserved, and have 
        a hard time breaking the ice. This may come off as standoffish, but taking the time to 
        include them in team conversations will reveal that they are an important part of the team.`,
		high: `scored on the higher end of extraversion, meaning they may seek excitement or adventure 
        and speak without thinking. They may enjoy taking the lead in group discussions and may be best 
        suited to being the spokesperson for the group.`,
